    Introduction:{

        p1:`          I'm Software Engineer based in Atlanta,Georgia who's harbor a great interest in exploring many different applications of programming.
        During the past two years, I have spent a tremendous amount of time learning and practicing computer programming, 
        mainly in anything surrounding web development and some android development,
        but I have also not forgotten to educate myself on the fundamentals like
        algorithms and data structures, problem-solving, and building practical applications`,

        p2:`          When it comes to web development, I mainly develop in Javascript for Client-Side and Server-Side, 
        althought lately I've been thinking of trying out SpringBoot using Kotlin. 
        When it comes to backend, I mainly use REST APIs, but have some experience with GRAPHQL. 
        Most of my projects use the NoSQL database of mongodb, this is the database that I feel most confident when trying to optimize queries, 
        and using advanced quering features. On the frontend side of things, 
        I've been bring more animation, and design skills like wireframing to make better applications. 
        I've mainly been using tailwind css when taking my wireframes to code, but also skilled in MaterialUI `,


        p3:`Lately I've been perfecting my web skills, and trying to expand my understanding of skills that are largely used in a professional settings. 
        Somethings I've been doing in the upcoming and past few days include learning framer motion for animation, learning the essentials of SQL, 
        filling in any gaps for kotlin that I might not understand before learning Springboot.
        Currently interested in any opportunities, contact information at the bottom.`

        paragraph: `I develop responsive, modern-looking front-ends.
        Most of the time, I use css , and  lately i've been using tailwind css for speed and ease of doing projects,
       I don't have much familiarity for component base css frameworks, but have an interest in learning one. As for JavaScript,
       I am an expert in React, and use a fair bit of Next.js for more complex projects with multiply pages.`

    backend: {
       
        paragraph:`For server applications or anything that runs outside of the browser, most of the time, I use Node.js, and sometimes I would just opt to learn different programming languages just to take advantage of specific features, 
        or mainly special libraries created by the community in this community. 
        When developing API,
        I always pay great attention to trying my best to limit the api calls clients will have to make, this applies to both front-end and back-end. In situation where users data is needed, I usually hash users passwords and use authentication tokens!`
