    Introduction:{

        p1:`          I'm a software engineers who's harbor a great interest in exploring many different applications of programming.
        During the past two years, I have spent a tremendous amount of time learning and practicing computer programming, mainly in anything surrounding web development 
        but I have also not forgotten to educate myself on the fundamentals like
        algorithms and data structures, problem-solving, and building and launching real-world products online.`,
        p2:`          When it comes to web development I currently use Javascript for the front-end and back-end. 
        On the front-end of side I understand the principles around css and javascript that i'm confident in make anything that requires of me, 
        but am often stunted due to lack of web design instead of anything like css.`,
        p3:`Lately I've taken a great interest into branching out of web development by learning Java, finally adding my second language and shifting into more complex languages that allow me control things like multithreading and restricting myself to object oriented principles.`

        paragraph: `I develop responsive, modern-looking front-ends.
        Most of the time, I use css , and  lately i've been using tailwind css for speed and ease of doing projects,
       I don't have much familiarity for component base css frameworks, but have an interest in learning one. As for JavaScript,
       I am an expert in React, and use a fair bit of Next.js for more complex projects with multiply pages.`

        paragraph:`For server applications or anything that runs outside of the browser, most of the time, I use Node.js, and sometimes I would just opt to learn different programming languages just to take advantage of specific features, 
        or mainly special libraries created by the community in this community. 
        When developing API,
        I always pay great attention to trying my best to limit the api calls clients will have to make, this applies to both front-end and back-end. In situation where users data is needed, I usually hash users passwords and use authentication tokens!`
