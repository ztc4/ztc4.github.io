      As a result of this being my first language, I learnt many features that are javacript specific like hoisting, event loop and even its prototype inheritance system(OOP for Javascript). `},

       Initially I learned javaFx, but even that seemed outdated. My current opinion of the language is that its useless outside of an corporate back-end development environment.
        When I first learned this language I was interested in implementing an artificial neural network, but I later realized I should of just learned python or went with C/C++.
        It might not be a total lost cause, because I might run into kotlin in the future`
